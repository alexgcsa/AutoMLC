All datasets were downloaded from the KDIS (KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS) repository:

**Datasets descriptions from the aforementioned repository**:

01 - Flags [Gonçalves et al. 2013]: This dataset contains details of some countries and their flags, and the goal is to predict some of the features. The dataset was used the first time for Multi-label Classification in [Gonçalves et al. 2013], and the original dataset can be found at the UCI repository.

02 - Scene [Boutell et al. 2004]: It is a image dataset, that contains 2407 images, annotated in up to 6 classes: beach, sunset, fall foliage, field, mountain and urban. Each image is described with 294 visual numeric features corresponding to spatial colour moments in the LUV space. 

03 - Birds [Briggs et al. 2013]: It is a dataset to predict the set of birds species that are present, given a ten-second audio clip.

04 - Yeast [Elisseeff and Weston 2001]: This dataset contains micro-array expressions and phylogenetic profiles for 2417 yeast genes. Each gen is annotated with a subset of 14 functional categories (e.g. Metabolism, energy, etc.) of the top level of the functional catalogue.

05 - Gpositive [Xu et al. 2016]: This dataset is used to predict the sub-cellular locations of proteins according to their sequences. It contains 519 sequences for Gram positive species. Both the GO (Gene ontology) features and PseAAC (including 20 amino acid, 20 pseudo-amino acid and 400 diptide components) are provided. There are 4 subcellular locations (cell membrane, cell wall, cytoplasm and extracell).

06 - CHD_49 [Shao et al. 2013]: This dataset has information of coronary heart disease (CHD) in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This dataset has been filtered by specialist removing irrelevant features, keeping only 49 features. 

07 - Water quality [Blockeel et al. 1999]: This dataset is used to predict the quality of water of Slovenian rivers, knowing 16 characteristics such as the temperature, ph, hardness, NO2 or C02. 

08 - Emotions [Tsoumakas et al. 2008]: Also called Music in [Read 2010]. Is a small dataset to classify music into emotions that it evokes according to the Tellegen-Watson-Clark model of mood: amazed-suprised, happy-pleased, relaxing-calm, quiet-still, sad-lonely and angry-aggresive. It consists of 593 songs with 6 classes. 

09 - Genbase [Diplaris et al. 2005]: It is a dataset for protein function classification. Each instance is a protein and each label is a protein class. This dataset is small comparatively with the large number of labels. 

10 - 3sources [Greene et al. 2009]: These datasets includes 948 news articles covering 416 distinct news stories from the period February–April 2009. They have been collected from 3 sources: BBC, Reuters and The Guardian. Of these stories, 169 were reported in all three sources, 194 in two sources, and 53 appeared in a single news source. Each story was manually annotated with one or more of the six topical labels: business, entertainment, health, politics, sport, technology. In this way, three datasets with the news from BBC, Reuters and The Guardian respectively are created. A feature selection method has been performed in order to reduce the feature space and achieve a better performance. Each dataset has been selected 1000 features. Also, a dataset with the intersection (3sources-inter3000) of these three datasets (news which are in all three sources) has been created with the union of the 1000 features of each one of the datasets. The 3soures-inter3000 dataset can be also considered as a Multi-View Multi-Label (MVML) dataset, since it includes features from 3 distinct sources. The original data has been downloaded from http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/3sources.html
